DUNE-library
============

[descriptional text missing]


Getting started
---------------

The easiest way to use Dune is to rename this directory "dune" if it
has a different name and tell the application about it. That's
it. Really. :)

If you want to install the Dune-headers globally on your system run
the following as "root":

  ./configure && make install
