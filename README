DUNE-library
============

Getting started
---------------

To compile a small library Dune has to check several components of
your system. Run

  ./configure

to commence those tests. Don't worry about messages telling you that
libraries are missing: they are only needed for grid-self-checks we
need for developing.

You can use

  ./configure --prefix=PATH

if you don't want Dune to be installed into /usr/local

After configuration

  make
  make install

build and install Dune (you may need root-permissions for the install
part depending on the prefix set)
